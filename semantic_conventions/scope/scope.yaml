        brief: >
         The short name for the instrumentation scope, which should generally be less than 15
         characters, and generally consist of a single word. It is not required to be globally
         unique, but should be unique enough to make it very unlikely to collide with other short
         names.  An example use is as the [namespace](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/blob/main/specification/OpenMetrics.md#metric-naming-and-namespaces)
         (prefix) for OpenMetrics metric names. It is recommended for the short_name to be
         related to the name of the scope.
        examples: ['mylibrary', 'otelmacaron']
